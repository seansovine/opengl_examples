# OpenGL and GLFW Examples

We're following the tutorial here: [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Hello-Window)

We used the instructions [here](https://www.glfw.org/docs/3.3/compile.html) to build and _not install_ GLFW.

Following the tutorial suggestion we used GLAD to configure OpenGL. See here: [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/).

We've made a build script that successfully compiles and links the first example in the tutorial.
