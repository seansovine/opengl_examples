# OpenGL Examples

Currently these examples are mostly slight modifications of examples from
Joey De Vries' excellent [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/) tutorial,
with a CMake build system and dependency management mostly adapted from
[gloom](https://github.com/aleksaro/gloom). However we plan to keep
expanding both the examples and the common infrastructure as we keep
learning more OpenGL programming. (By "we" here I mean "me" :)
